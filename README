This package contains the analysis software for analyzing the output of
Modules/Calibration/ResidualsModuleBR/ResidualsModuleBR.cc. The
procedure for performing the analysis is the following:

1) Submit a reconstruction sequence with the module
ResidualsModuleBR

in the module sequence file.

2) Perform an hadd on all output files. Move the resulting
ROOT file into this directory.

3) Type 'make' in this directory.

4) Run ./ResidualsCalculator -i [inputFile]. The files
averages-[inputFile] and [inputFile].txt
will be produced. The first contains QA information, and the
second contains the residual correction factors.

4a) Use the optional flag ' -l / --localTrackResiduals' to calculate
residuals spanning only one TPC.

5) Run the ROOT macro for plotting the results:
> root 'PlotResiduals("averages-[inputFile]")'
This will produce the file averages-[inputFile].pdf. Ensure
the output is reasonable.

6) Move the result file [inputFile].txt to the desired
database location.

7) Re-run the jobs with the residuals correction
enabled. Check the QA plots for proper correction of
track residuals.

8) [optional] Re-run the correction with the flag '--updateResiduals'
and the file TPCResidualsFixedManager.xml pointing to a folder
containing the previously-calculated corrections. This will update the
corrections, allowing the correction to be run iteratively.

Have fun!
